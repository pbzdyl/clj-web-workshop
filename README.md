# clj-web-workshop

## How to use it?

The project provides:

- exercises and example solutions for them
- Intellij run configurations for
  - starting the project REPL
  - starting web app
  - starting auto tests (unit tests will be rerun on each source code change)
- Postman collection for testing project's REST endpoints

Each exercise has its own branch (e.g. `exercise1`, `exercise2` etc.).
To work on a specific exercise just checkout its branch.
When switching always restart your running tasks (REPL, web app or auto tests) to avoid problems with stale code.

To complete the exercise, take a look at its description in its namespace file.
There are also unit tests that will help with checking your solution.
Postman collection provides easy to use requests for end-to-end tests.

There are also branches providing example solutions (e.g. `exercise1` -> `solution1`).
